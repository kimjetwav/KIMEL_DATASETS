Welcome to the alpha version of the Kimel datalad datasets.

This page exists to inform you of what's available here, though so far it's just POND.

The POND dataset is divisible into these subdatasets:

```log
POND
POND/data/baseline/bids
POND/data/baseline/blacklist
POND/data/multisess/bids
POND/pipelines/fmriprep/out/ciftify
POND/pipelines/fmriprep/out/ciftify/qc_fmri
POND/pipelines/fmriprep/out/ciftify/qc_recon_all
POND/pipelines/fmriprep/out/fmriprep
POND/pipelines/fmriprep/out/freesurfer
POND/pipelines/fmriprep/out/freesurfer/enigma_qc/figures
```

On SciNet, you may currently fetch these with `datalad install`, as well as any of the individual subject directories located under these superdatasets.

In the future there will be more here, and more convenient ways to access these.
